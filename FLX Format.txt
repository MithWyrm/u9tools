The FLX format is used to glob lots of data files into one big file.
No provision is made to store names of files, so they must be indexed
by number (although another file probably provides a name to number
lookup).  There is a possibility that the user of this format does
not want the first data item in the file to be item 0, so there may
be provision for this in the header.  I doubt this is the case tho,
as at least one of the files has blank directory entries in the first
few slots, presumably to effect this.

Multi-byte integer formats are little-endian.


Header format:

 Ofs(h)    Len(h)    Format    Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     0        4C     text      copyright information (?), blanked out
    4C         4     dword     ?? initial item number ??
    50         4     dword     number of entries = n
    54         4     dword     ?? initial item number ?? version number ??
    58         4     dword     total file size
    5C         4     dword     total file size (?)
    60        20      ??       ??
    80        8n     dir.      list of directory entries
     x         x     data      actual data



Directory entry format:

 Ofs(h)    Len(h)    Format    Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     0         4     dword     offset of data (from beginning of file)
     4         4     dword     length of data
